Consultation on data quality tests for the 2016 Aid Transparency Index
===========================================

Go straight to the [Indicators to add your comments &raquo;](https://github.com/pwyf/2016-index-data-quality-tests/issues)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We welcome feedback on the data quality tests run against IATI-XML data as part of the Aid Transparency Index.

This consultation runs until **30th September**. We will confirm the final tests that will be used in 2016 shortly thereafter.

We are using Github Issues to record:
* the most recent tests used (in the 2014 Aid Transparency Index or the 2015 Aid Transparency Reviews);
* the initial ideas on improvements we are considering;
* any feedback from the public consultation process.

If you have any comments on the tests for each indicator, please add them under the relevant [issue](https://github.com/pwyf/2016-index-data-quality-tests/issues).

Please note that this consultation is only on data quality tests used for IATI-XML data and not on the Index indicators or the overall methodology. All 39 indicators used in the Aid Transparency Index will be retained.
